# Random-Forest-Model-applied-to-the-Stock-Market

THis project includes code that was developed from scratch to make Random Forest models (RFM), including a Classifier with replacement spliting criteria (Gini or Entropy) and a Regressor model for continuous price evaluation.

## The Project
Interactive financial analysis dashboard featuring custom Random Forest models (RFM) for stock &amp; forex prediction. Compares performance of personally made RFM against sklearn with visualisations, technical indicators, and Alpha Vantage integration, along with Analysis of results of classifier or regressor models.

This dashboard is the emalgimation of two different projects, RFM classifier and RFM regressor.
